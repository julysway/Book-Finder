📚 Book List Display: Books are displayed in a grid format with title, author, and cover image.

🎨 Modern UI: Styled with CSS for an intuitive and responsive design.

📌 Pagination: Users can navigate between pages and choose how many results to display per page (5, 10, 15, or 20).

🔗 Details Section: Each book entry has a button to view more details.
